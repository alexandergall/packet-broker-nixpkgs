# Packet Broker Release 5


   * The SDE is upgraded to version 9.9.0
   * Support for the Tofino2 reference platform AS9516-32D
   * Support for the Tofino1/Tofino2 software emulation
     (a.k.a. "Tofino model"). This makes it possible to install the
     packet broker on systems that don't have an actual ASIC for
     testing purposes.
